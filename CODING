Notes on the coding style used in mange.

I do have my own coding style that differs from what I commonly see.
My style is farily similar to the K&R style (but note opening function
brace placement) with a strong focus on being compact, but readable ...
at least to me.

You may also note a stark *lack* of commenting.  There are two reasons for this,
one is philosophical, the other is just laziness ... I should comment my
code better.  On the philosophical end though the better the code is written
the less commenting is needed AND most code commenting I encounter is
entirely unhelpful and - in fact - quite disturbing.

Some code commenting takes up a lot of space breaking up the logical flow
of the code while providing no information.

I've seen many cases with something much like the following:

> /*********************
> /  In the following
> /  line we will start
> /  a for loop that
> /  will loop through
> /  the variable i
> /  for values from zero
> /  to the value of X
> /***********************/
>
>
> // Heres that for loop
> for (i=0; i<X; i++) {

That comment provides no information that was not in the one line of code!

Yet in the same files I will see variables used that have obscure and unruly
names that are declared *far* from their first use with no comment to say
what the variable is for.

I comment things that need work, or areas of code that may be hard to follow.
I aim to use variable names and function names that are informative.  An
exception may be some very short variable names - in almost every case a
very short variable name will be some sort of temporary variable, placeholder
or loop counter - each of these should be clear from the context.

I believe I have stuck to a pattern of using x and y as screen coordinates
and i and j as column and row numbers in the spreadsheet.  In a few functions
ti and tj are declared - these are temporary i and j variables.

Yes - I should comment more.  But I believe there is a happy medium between
my spartan comments and the comment-cancer that plagues much source code I
encounter.

But now it's time to get off my soapbox.

I hope you enjoy Mange, and I hope - if you peruse the code - that you don't
find it too frustrating.  Realize that this was initially made for personal
use out of personal need - if others start using it more, I will be happy
to make it more other-user friendly.
