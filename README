"All spreadsheet editors suck, this one just sucks less." *

This README file is under construction:
 Sorry, that's what you get for grabbing a beta package.
 If you are reading this. Feel free to contact jmcclure@cns.umass.edu
 for further information and/or updates.

MANGE:
 Mange is intended to be to datafiles what mutt is to email.
 Mange is a ncurses-based console flatfile (eg CSV, TSV) editor.
 Future versions of mange should include many useful functions,
 but this is not intended to be a data-analysis package (see R
 for that).  This project was born out of a frustration with
 attempting to edit CSV files in my otherwise-loved editor, nano.  
 Mange is a lightweight editor following the K.I.S.S. principle,
 the advantage over a good editor such as nano is that mange keeps
 track of rows and columns, allows for operations on cells, rows,
 or columns, and displays each of these in an easy to read manner.
 Mange does include basic plotting functionality that should be
 sufcicient for a quick overview of descriptive data.

*NOTE:
 I have no connection or affiliation with the developers of mutt,
 though I hope it will be recognized that imitation is the highest
 form of flattery, and I can only hope my attempt to bring the 
 "mutt spirit" to a flatfile editor will be successful.

INSTALL
	please see INSTALL file or just try "./configure && make install"

CODING
	please see CODING file for information on my "coding conventions" and other
	bits and bobs if you plan on perusing or editing the source code.

USAGE:  <this will be better organized and documented in upcoming versions>

$ mange <filename | -h | -sX | -p>

-h		display help and exit (not yet...)
-sX		sets the field delimiter to 'X' (eg -s\t for tsv files)
-p		for command line access to plotting functions - this must be the last command line
		option as everything that follows this is treated as input to the plot command (see below)
		(Plotting from the command line is not *quite* functional.  It functions, but the graph is not saved yet)

If no filename is provided mange will open an empty 10x10 buffer.

General functions:
	
	ARROWS (UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT)
		move cursor from cell to cell
	
	ENTER
		enter edit mode.
	
	:
		enter command mode
		
	DEL | BACKSPACE | d | D | CTL-K
		enter delete mode
	
	INS | i | I
		enter insert mode
	
	CTL-X
		exit
	CTL-U
		undo

Edit mode:
-use arrows to move, keys to type.
	ENTER
		on a changed cell: save cell changes and move to the next lower cell for editing.
		on an unchanged cell:  exit edit mode
	TAB
		save cell changes and move to the next cell to the right for editing

Command mode functions:
	quit
		exits
	save [filename]
		saves the current buffer to 'filename'
		if no name is provided the current filename will be used
	open [filename]
		opens a file or an empty buffer if no name is provided
	undo
		undoes last action [20 undo levels at present]
	plot <formula> [<parameter> [<parameter> [...]]]
		Creates and displays a plot of data.  Uses R formula notation and accepts optional graphics
		parameters.  See R documentation for a full list of options.  If any option includes spaces
		enclose the entire option in sinlge quotes ('). Separate parameters with spaces, not commas.
		EXAMPLE: plot y~x+a xlab="X_var" yab="Y_var"
			if x and why are numeric this creates a scatter plot with points color coded by variable 'a'
			if y is numeric and x is not this creates a barplot grouped by variable 'a'
	saveplot [filename]
		Save the last viewed plot in jpeg format. 
	(commands)
		future versions will include the ability to parse the current buffer (file) through
		other tools such as grep, awk, or sed.  This should also work with any shell, perl,
		python, or other script that can read from a stdin pipe and output to stdout.

Delete / Insert mode functions:
-You will be prompted for C, R, or E
	C | c
		Delete the current column, or insert a new column to the right of the current one
	R | r
		Delete the current row, or insert a new row below the current one
	E | e
		Delete the current entry (aka cell), or insert a new entry
-If you delete or insert a single entry you may be prompted for a direction [ DISABLED in v0.1b ]
	UP
		shifts column up to fill deleted cell
	DOWN
		shifts column down to make room for inserted cell (note, the cell at the bottom will be lost)
	LEFT	
		shifts row left to fill deleted cell
	RIGHT
		shifts row right to make room for inserted cell (note, the cell at the far right will be lost)
	E | e
		Leave a deleted cell Empty
