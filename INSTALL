VERSION:
 This is a beta version that is actively under development. Many features
 are functional, many others are not.  Use at your own risk!  Please report bugs
 to the above address.

INSTALL:
 The configure script is currently 'handmade' and does not do any of the normal
 compatibility checks.  Mange is, however, fairly simple.  You will need a working
 gcc (compiler) and the ncurses library.  These can be obtained from any major
 repository.
 
 For plotting, mange uses the GNU R statistical software package.  If this is not
 available plotting will not function.  Mange currently uses feh to view plots -
 this can be changed prior to compiling by editing line 14 of mange.h appropriately.
 In future versions this will be customizable through a rc file - but not yet.
 
 Mange is preconfigured to install to the active user's "~/bin/" folder.  This can 
 be modified by editing the makefile after running configure, or by editting the
 configure script beforehand.
 
 Configure options:
 	--no-plot
 		Disable R plotting abilities.

JUST THE FACTS:
 $ ./confiure
 $ make install

See README file for a further description of this package with some instructions
on usage.
