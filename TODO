**ROADMAP**
 Following is a list of goals for each release.  If you have received
a copy of this package for testing I'd be interested in receiving bug
notifications and feature requests at jmcclure@cns.umass.edu

 Much of this may be in my own 'note to self' format.  If it makes sense
to you, great; if not ... delete it.

*v0.1* <spring 2012>
	- Bug fixes from beta

*v0.2* <anticipated: summer 2012>
	- Reimplement/Repair disabled functions:
		I don't know why these were failing in the pre-beta release, but as they are rarely enough
		used I disabled them for the time being.
		- shifts with deleteCell->entry
		- insertCell->entry
		- make sure shifts do not read from outside of buffer
	- Add filters grep and sed to command mode
	- Add arbitrary filers to command mode (for command line tools/scripts such as perl, python, bash, etc)
	- Add 'help' systems and manual
	- Add optional "syntax" highlighting: urls, emails, numbers, strings, etc.

...

*v0.x*
	- Bug fixes from earlier v0.x's

*v1.0b*
	- Read settings at runtime from an rc file for:
		- key bindings
		- standard colors & syntax highlighting options
		- default image viewer
		- ... ?
